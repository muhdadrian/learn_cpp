// Functional separation

// In the example in 74, it’s easy to see that variables a and b are different variables from x and y.

// Now consider the following similar program:

#include <iostream>

int add(int x, int y) // add's x and y are created and enter scope here
{
    // add's x and y are visible/usable within this function only
    return x + y;
} // add's y and x go out of scope and are destroyed here

int main()
{
    int x{ 5 }; // main's x is created, initialized, and enters scope here
    int y{ 6 }; // main's y is created, initialized, and enters scope here

    // main's x and y are usable within this function only
    std::cout << add(x, y) << '\n'; // calls function add() with x=5 and y=6

    return 0;
} // main's y and x go out of scope and are destroyed here

// In this example, all we’ve done is change the names of variables a and b inside of function main to x and y. This program compiles and runs identically, even though functions main and add both have variables named x and y. Why does this work?

// First, we need to recognize that even though functions main and add both have variables named x and y, these variables are distinct. The x and y in function main have nothing to do with the x and y in function add -- they just happen to share the same names.

// Second, when inside of function main, the names x and y refer to main’s locally scoped variables x and y. Those variables can only be seen (and used) inside of main. Similarly, when inside function add, the names x and y refer to function parameters x and y, which can only be seen (and used) inside of add.

// In short, neither add nor main know that the other function has variables with the same names. Because the scopes don’t overlap, it’s always clear to the compiler which x and y are being referred to at any time.

//Key insight: Names used for function parameters or variables declared in a function body are only visible within the function that declares them. This means local variables within a function can be named without regard for the names of variables in other functions. This helps keep functions independent.
