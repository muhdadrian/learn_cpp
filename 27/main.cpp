// Introduction to expressions

// five() is a function that returns the value 5
int five()
{
    return 5;
}

int main()
{
    int a{ 2 };             // initialize variable a with literal value 2
    int b{ 2 + 3 };         // initialize variable b with computed value 5
    int c{ (2 * 3) + 4 };   // initialize variable c with computed value 10
    int d{ b };             // initialize variable d with variable value 5
    int e{ five() };        // initialize variable e with function return value 5

    return 0;
}

// Note that the initializers above make use of a variety of different entities: literals, variables, operators, and function calls. Somehow, C++ is converting all of these different things into a single value that can then be used as the initial value for the variable.
// What do all of these initializers have in common? They make use of an expression.
// In general programming, an expression is a non-empty sequence of literals, variables, operators, and function calls that calculates a value. The process of executing an expression is called evaluation, and the resulting value produced is called the result of the expression (also sometimes called the return value).


// When an expression is evaluated, each of the terms inside the expression are evaluated, until a single value remains. Here are some examples of different kinds of expressions, with comments indicating how they evaluate:

2               // 2 is a literal that evaluates to value 2
"Hello world!"  // "Hello world!" is a literal that evaluates to text "Hello world!"
x               // x is a variable that evaluates to the value held by variable x
2 + 3           // operator+ uses operands 2 and 3 to evaluate to value 5
five()          // evaluates to the return value of function five()

// As you can see, literals evaluate to their own values. Variables evaluate to the value of the variable. Operators (such as operator+) use their operands to evaluate to some other value. We haven’t covered function calls yet, but in the context of an expression, function calls evaluate to whatever value the function returns.

// For advanced readers: Expressions involving operators with side effects are a little more tricky:
x = 5           // x = 5 has side effect of assigning 5 to x, evaluates to x
x = 2 + 3       // has side effect of assigning 5 to x, evaluates to x
std::cout << x  // has side effect of printing value of x to console, evaluates to std::cout


// Key insight: Wherever a single value is expected in C++, you can use an value-producing expression instead, and the expression will be evaluated to produce a single value.


// Expressions do not end in a semicolon, and cannot be compiled by themselves. For example, if you were to try compiling the expression x = 5, your compiler would complain (probably about a missing semicolon). Rather, expressions are always evaluated as part of statements.
// For example, take this statement:
int x{ 2 + 3 }; // 2 + 3 is an expression that has no semicolon -- the semicolon is at the end of the statement containing the expression
// If you were to break this statement down into its syntax, it would look like this:
type identifier { expression };
// type could be any valid type (we chose int). identifier could be any valid name (we chose x). And expression could be any valid expression (we chose 2 + 3, which uses two literals and an operator).
