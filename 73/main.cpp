// Local scope (block scope)

// An identifier’s scope determines where the identifier can be seen and used within the source code. When an identifier can be seen and used, we say it is in scope. When an identifier can not be seen, we can not use it, and we say it is out of scope. Scope is a compile-time property, and trying to use an identifier when it is not in scope will result in a compile error.

// The identifier of a local variable has local scope. An identifier with local scope (technically called block scope) is usable from the point of definition to the end of the innermost pair of curly braces containing the identifier (or for function parameters, at the end of the function). This ensures local variables cannot be used before the point of definition (even if the compiler opts to create them before then) or after they are destroyed. Local variables defined in one function are also not in scope in other functions that are called.

// Here’s a program demonstrating the scope of a variable named x:

#include <iostream>

// x is not in scope anywhere in this function
void doSomething()
{
    std::cout << "Hello!\n";
}

int main()
{
    // x can not be used here because it's not in scope yet

    int x{ 0 }; // x enters scope here and can now be used within this function

    doSomething();

    return 0;
} // x goes out of scope here and can no longer be used

// In the above program, variable x enters scope at the point of definition. x goes out of scope at the end of the innermost pair of curly braces containing the identifier, which is the closing curly brace of function main(). Note that variable x is not in scope anywhere inside of function doSomething. The fact that function main calls function doSomething is irrelevant in this context.

/*
“Out of scope” vs “going out of scope”

The terms “out of scope” and “going out of scope” can be confusing to new programmers.

An identifier is out of scope anywhere it cannot be accessed within the code. In the example above, the identifier x is in scope from its point of definition to the end of the main function. The identifier x is out of scope outside of that code region.

The term “going out of scope” is typically applied to objects rather than identifiers. We say an object goes out of scope at the end of the scope (the end curly brace) in which the object was instantiated. In the example above, the object named x goes out of scope at the end of the function main.

A local variable’s lifetime ends at the point where it goes out of scope, so local variables are destroyed at this point.

Note that not all types of variables are destroyed when they go out of scope. We’ll see examples of these in future lessons.
